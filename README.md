## Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions

| # | Question | Solution |
|---| -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Given an array, find the average of all contiguous sub-arrays of size ‘K’ in it. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/AverageOfSubArrayOfSizeK.java) |
| 2 | Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k’, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/MaximumSubArrayOfSizeK.java) |
| 3 | Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/SmallestSubArrayOfSumK.java) |
| 4 | Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/LongestSubStringDistinctK.java) |
| 5 | Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit. You can start with any tree, but once you have started you can’t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/MaximumFruitCountOf2Count.java) |
