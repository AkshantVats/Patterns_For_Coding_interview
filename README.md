## Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions

| # | Question | Solution |
|---| -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Given an array, find the average of all contiguous sub-arrays of size ‘K’ in it. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/AverageOfSubArrayOfSizeK.java) |
| 2 | Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k’, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/MaximumSubArrayOfSizeK.java) |
| 3 | Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/SmallestSubArrayOfSumK.java) |
| 4 | Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/LongestSubStringDistinctK.java) |
| 5 | Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit. You can start with any tree, but once you have started you can’t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Sliding_Window_Pattern_Practice_Questions/MaximumFruitCountOf2Count.java) |


## Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions

| # | Question | Solution |
|---| -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions/SmallestSubArrayOfSumK.java) |
| 2 | Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space; after removing the duplicates in-place return the new length of the array. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions/RemoveDuplicateFromSortedArray.java) |
| 3 | Given a sorted array, create a new array containing squares of all the number of the input array in the sorted order. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions/SquaresFromSortedArray.java) |
| 4 | Given an array of unsorted numbers, find all unique triplets in it that add up to zero. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions/UniqueTripletsNonSortedArray.java) |
| 5 | Given an array of unsorted numbers and a target number, find a triplet in the array whose sum is as close to the target number as possible, return the sum of the triplet. If there are more than one such triplet, return the sum of the triplet with the smallest sum. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions/ClosetSumTripletsNonSortedArray.java) |

## Fast_Slow_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions

| # | Question | Solution |
|---| -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a cycle in it or not. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions/CheckIsCyclicLinkedList.java) |
| 2 | Given the head of a LinkedList with a cycle, find the length of the cycle. | [Java](https://github.com/AkshantVats/Patterns_For_Coding_interview/blob/master/Java/Two_Pointer_Pattern_Practice_Questions/FindLengthCyclicLinkedList.java) |
